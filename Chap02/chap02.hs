-- lazy evaluation
-- the function infinity runs, if called directly, until infinity
infinity = 1 + infinity
-- three is a non-strict function, which returns 3, regardless of the argument given to it
three x = 3
-- if we now call three with infinity as it's argument, infinity is not evaluated, because of Haskells lazy evaluation
-- instead, three just returns 3, since the evaluation of it's argument isn't necessary for returning the result

-- three infinity
